# staff_survey

A {golem} powered summary of some free text survey data from staff.

Having summary tables of categorised free text data is something I do over and over again and this is an attempt to produce something that is reusable and properly factored so I can port it to other applications easily. I have also included some rudimentary tests and split the tables and the text summaries into different modules.

I think this is still not quite the right approach but doing it has helped me to understand where I'm going wrong. I can't post the data because it's confidential but if you ever come across this repo and are curious to see how it works file an issue and I'll try to post some fake data to make it work. Or I may get round to doing that at some point anyway, but not today because this code was supposed to be finished two days ago!
